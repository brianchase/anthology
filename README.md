## ABOUT

This project aims to provide a free, open anthology of readings in the
history of Western philosophy, drawing exclusively on works in the
public domain. The selections cover every major period of Western
philosophy through the early twentieth century. Since my focus is on
adding and editing texts and, to a lesser extent, developing the
style, the anthology contains no introduction or other explanatory
material. This may change someday.

The project's style file, `anthology.sty`, permits different layouts.
For the most part, however, I work on two: a one column layout for
letter paper, which is largely the same as that for A5 paper, and a
one column ebook layout for half letter paper (8.5 × 5.5 in). Current
binaries of the anthology are available at these links:

* [eBook Layout](http://hesperusisphosphorus.com/projects/anthology-ebook.pdf "eBook Layout") (PDF)
* [Letter Paper Layout](http://hesperusisphosphorus.com/projects/anthology-letter.pdf "Letter Paper Layout") (PDF)

## CONTENTS

The anthology contains over fifty texts of widely varying lengths. I
don't intend it as representative of Western philosophy. Nor do I
select a text with much thought about whether it's representative of
that figure or in some way historically important. I don't even worry
about whether the figure typically counts as a philosopher. Some
selections caught my attention because I find them entertaining, like
the ones from Gellius, Stevenson, and Twain. Others represent a genre
of sorts or have been useful for stimulating discussion in class.
Still others merely demonstrate what sort of material is available in
the public domain, even if I'd always prefer to assign contemporary
editions of those texts. And finally, I've added some texts because
they might serve, or have served, as primary or supplemental readings
for my courses.

## REQUIREMENTS

The main requirement is [TeX Live](http://www.tug.org/texlive "TeX
Live"). I compile the anthology with whatever
[version](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?q=texlive) is in the
official repositories at [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/ "Arch
Linux"), since that's my distribution of choice. In addition, the
style compiles with [XeTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XeTeX
"XeTeX"), which is available with TeX Live, and [Windy
City](http://github.com/brianchase/windycity "Windy City"), which
isn't. The latter is my own style for
[biblatex](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex "biblatex") and formats
citations in the text. Although biblatex comes with TeX Live, I often,
but not always, use a more recent version of it. This isn't likely to
cause problems if you try to compile the anthology on your own
system, but it's possible. In short, the requirements are:

* [TeX Live](http://www.tug.org/texlive "TeX Live") with [XeTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XeTeX "XeTeX")
* [Windy City](http://github.com/brianchase/windycity "Windy City") with [biblatex](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex "biblatex")
