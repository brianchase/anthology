# ABOUT

This project aims to provide a free, open anthology of readings for
courses in philosophy, drawing exclusively on works in the public
domain. The selection of texts cover every major period of Western
philosophy through the early twentieth century. Since my focus is on
adding and editing texts and, to a lesser extent, developing the
layout, the anthology contains no introduction or other explanatory
material. This may change someday.

The project's style file, `anthology.sty`, permits different layouts.
For the most part, however, I focus on two: a one column layout for
letter paper, which is largely the same as that for A5 paper, and a
one column ebook layout for half letter paper (8.5 × 5.5 in). Current
binaries of the anthology are available at these links:

# CONTENTS

The anthology contains over fifty texts of widely varying lengths. I
don't intend it as representative of Western philosophy. Nor do I
select a text with much focus on whether it's representative of that
figure or in some way historically important. I don't even worry about
whether the figure typically counts as a philosopher. Some selections
caught my attention because I find them entertaining, like the ones
from Gellius, Stevenson, and Twain. Others represent a genre of sorts
or have been useful for stimulating discussion in class. Still others
merely demonstrate what sort of material is available in the public
domain, even if I'd always prefer to assign contemporary editions of
those texts. And finally, I've added some texts because they might
serve, or have served, as primary or supplemental readings for my
courses. Perhaps I'll add a dozen or so texts before considering the
anthology complete. In any case, the list below is current:

# REQUIREMENTS

The main requirement is [TeX Live](http://www.tug.org/texlive). I
compile the anthology with whatever
[version](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?q=texlive) is in the
official repositories at [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/),
since that's my distribution of choice. In addition, the style
compiles with [XeTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XeTeX), which is
available with TeX Live, and [Windy
City](http://github.com/brianchase/windycity), which doesn't. The
latter is my own style for
[biblatex](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex), which formats notes and
bibliographies. Although biblatex comes with TeX Live, I often, but
not always, use a more recent version of it. This isn't likely to
cause problems if you try to compile the anthology on your own system,
but it's possible. In short, the requirements are:

* [TeX Live](http://www.tug.org/texlive) with [XeTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XeTeX)
* [Windy City](http://github.com/brianchase/windycity) for [biblatex](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex)
