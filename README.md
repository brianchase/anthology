# ABOUT

The aim of this project is a free, open anthology of readings for
introductory courses in philosophy, drawing exclusively on works in
the public domain. The project has a fair but growing selection of
texts, all of which have been carefully edited against the sources
cited in the anthology. Since my focus is on adding texts and, to a
lesser extent, developing the layout, the project includes no
introduction or other explanatory material. This may change someday. A
compiled version of the anthology is [available
here](http://hesperusisphosphorus.com/prj/anthology.pdf) (PDF).
