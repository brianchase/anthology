# Anthology

## About

This project aims to provide a free, open anthology of readings in the
history of Western philosophy, drawing exclusively on works in the
public domain. The selections cover every major period of Western
philosophy through the early twentieth century. Since my focus is on
adding and editing texts and, to a lesser extent, developing the
style, the anthology contains no introduction or other explanatory
material. This may change someday.

The project's style file, `anthology.sty`, permits different layouts.
For the most part, however, I work on two: a one column layout for
letter paper, which is largely the same as that for A5 paper, and a
one column ebook layout for half letter paper (8.5 in × 5.5 in).
Current binaries of the anthology are available here:

* [eBook Layout](https://s3.amazonaws.com/brianchase/anthology-ebook.pdf "eBook Layout") (PDF)

## Contents

The anthology contains over fifty texts of varying lengths. I don't
intend it as representative of Western philosophy. Nor do I select a
text with much thought about whether it's representative of that
figure or in some way historically important. I don't even worry about
whether the figure typically counts as a philosopher. Some selections
caught my attention because I find them entertaining, like the ones
from Gellius and Twain. Others represent a genre of sorts or have been
useful for stimulating discussion in class. Still others merely
demonstrate what sort of material is available in the public domain,
even if I'd always assign contemporary editions of those texts. And
finally, I've added some texts because they might serve, or have
served, as primary or supplemental readings for my courses.
